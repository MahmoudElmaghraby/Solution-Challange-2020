# Solution-Challange-2020
This is our project to be presented in the Solution Challange competition.

Our Project consist of Hardware and Software.
- Hardware part: its a rubbish basket that has QR code that needs to be scanned to open the basket.
But unfortunately, according to the pandemic status that we face nowadays, we can't build the hardware part but we have the method of implementation.
- Software part: Mobile app that scans QR code and adds points for the user every time he scans rubbish basket code and throws the rubbish in it.
Then the user can win prizes according to the number of points he has.

Here is what is done in our Android app:
